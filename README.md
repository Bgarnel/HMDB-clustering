# TRYYYYYYY
`main.ipynb` - This method does not work as intended. Reason being that we first create molecular fingerprints based on similiraty between all pairs possible for all the molecules and then do clustering on them. That means that we are clustering 

### Standardize or not to standardize, that is the question

Typically, data is standardized before performing a PCA. 
However, in the case of map4 fingerprints, I find that standarization might not be necessary due to being messured in the same scale (despite variations spanning three orders of magnitud). 
One would use standarization when contrasting disparate units like the height of a tree and the girth of the same tree. 

Altough HMDB database contains diverse lipids, phospholipids... which could explain the difference in magnitud for some fingerprints? So maybe standarization is due?

Let's try doing it and see what happens...

When it comes to using PCA, data standarization is usually the go-to step. However, the situation is a bit different with map4 fingerprints. Despite having variations that span three orders of magnitude (1e05 / 1e08) these fingerprints are actually measured on a consistent scale (map4). This makes me wonder if standarization is really necessary...
Statistics is not my area of expertise so i could be wrong!

We're comparing apples to apples so to speak... For instance, you'd standardize when comparing something like the height of a tree and the tree's girth â€“ they're completely different units.

However... the HMDB database contains all sorts of stuff, lipids, phospholipids... This variety might be the reason behind the magnitude differences we're seeing in some fingerprints. Could standarization help with that??

We'll give standarization a shot and see if it changes things. Maybe it'll clear things up, maybe not. Either way, we'll get a better sense of whether standarization plays a role or not
